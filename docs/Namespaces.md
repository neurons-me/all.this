# Namespaces

A system where data representation and interaction are contextualized based on the user. **Namespaces** play a crucial role in this. The 'Spaces' concept you're integrating into "Cleaker" allows for dynamic data representations unique to each user's perspective. Given the decentralization emphasis, this sounds like a use-case appropriate for technologies like blockchain or distributed ledgers, where data immutability, security, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are foundational.

## Technical Realization:

### Hosting The Knowledge (Protocol):

The codebase, or the protocol, can be hosted on platforms like GitHub, making it open and accessible for users and developers.

### Namespaces & Dynamic Interaction:

Namespaces are structured as URIs or paths, allowing for easy identification and parsing.

```
username.cleaker.me
```

User-specific data representation can be achieved by associating metadata with each namespace. This metadata can be encrypted such that only the respective user can decrypt and understand the true meaning behind each namespace's content.

### Decentralized Identities (DIDs):

Using DIDs, every user will have a unique, persistent identifier.

This DID can serve as the base for all of a user's namespaces, ensuring data representation and interactions are always user-contextualized.
Consider using platforms like uPort or Sovrin to manage decentralized identities.

### Dynamic Interaction Based on User Context:

Interaction handlers should first decrypt and interpret a user's namespace metadata before deciding how to process the interaction.
For instance, if a user interacts with an image, the system would first decrypt the associated metadata, realize the user perceives it as a cat, and handle the interaction accordingly.

### Decentralized Network Accessibility:

A decentralized network ensures that namespaces are globally accessible, but only interpretable by users with the correct decryption keys.
Consider integrating with existing decentralized platforms like Ethereum for establishing your network. Smart contracts can assist in defining interaction rules within this network.

### Security & Privacy:

Encryption will be critical. Each user's metadata should be encrypted using their unique keys, ensuring only they can decrypt and understand their data.
Interactions between users can employ end-to-end encryption methods, guaranteeing privacy and security.

### In Practice:

Imagine Alice and Bob both use the platform.

Alice's context associates the namespace cleaker123:space:images:pic1.jpg with a cat picture.

Bob's context, however, might associate the same namespace with a picture of a car.

When Alice accesses cleaker123:space:images:pic1.jpg, her decryption keys will interpret metadata pointing to a cat image. Bob, however, will interpret a car image.

If they share the same namespace, Alice will see a cat, and Bob will see a car. They interact within the same shared 'space' but perceive it differently based on their individual contexts.

In essence, this architecture allows users to operate in a shared digital realm, yet perceive and interact with it uniquely based on their personal contexts. It's a blend of shared infrastructure with individualized experiences, driven by decentralized technology.
