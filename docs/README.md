# Welcome to `all.this`
A package to unify **`all.this`**.

The `all.this` collection of packages, along with the proposed `cleaker` and `this.me` functionality, is an approach to create a modular system where each module (like `this.text`, `this.video`, `this.img`, etc.) (all.this family) represents a distinct data structure or class. These modules, when combined with `cleaker`, generate unique **public and private key pairs**, essentially giving each instance its cryptographic identity.

## Modular Data Structures:
Each module, such as this.text, this.video, or this.img, represents a specific data structure or class.
These classes encapsulate the functionalities and data specific to their domain. For example, this.audio handles audio data and operations, while this.wallet manage cryptocurrency transactions and balances.


## Import and use it in your project:
1. Install the package:
   ```bash
   npm i all.this
   ```

## Example Usage
Module can be used like this:
```javascript
const allThis = require('all.this');
allThis.init('suign');
```

### Conceptual Flow:
- [ ] Initiate and set up a context with [this.me.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.me)
- [ ] Create [neurons.me](https://www.neurons.me) neural networks.
- [ ] Define the data you'd like your neural network to recognize or process with [this.](https://www.neurons.me/this) modules.
- [ ] Use [this.be](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.be) to maintain a state or context, - watching over the [PixelGrid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.pixel) and any other states you define for example.
- [ ] Define desired status and handlers, [be.this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/be.this).
- [ ] Keep [i.mlearning](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i.mlearning).

Default Local Network set to: `.me`
**`v://me`**
Port **888**
**Cleaker** is a **person**, **place** or **thing** in **space** and **time**.
**Cleaker** is a **reference** to a **person**, **place** or **thing** in **space** and **time**.
**Cleaker** is a **relational** **database**.

> **user.cleaker.me**  --->  **i.mlearning**  ->  **all.this**

Enjoy integrating and building upon `all.this`!
