# Welcome to `all.this`
A package to unify [**`all.this`**.](https://www.neurons.me/this)

**all.this** serves as a central framework for managing a suite of **modular packages**, each tailored to specific data structures and functionalities. 

Leveraging cryptographic principles, each module within the all.this family, like [this.text](https://suign.github.io/this.text/), [this.video](https://suign.github.io/this.video/), [this.img](https://suign.github.io/this.img/), is equipped with **unique cryptographic identities**, thanks to their integration with [**cleaker**.](https://suign.github.io/cleaker/)

## Modular Data Structures:
Each module (like: [this.text](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.text), [this.video](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.video), or [this.img](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.img)), represents a specific **data structure** or **class**.
These classes encapsulate the functionalities and data specific to their domain. For example, [this.audio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.audio) handles audio data and operations, while [this.wallet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.wallet) manage cryptocurrency transactions and balances.

*The integration with `cleaker` ensures each module instance has a **[unique cryptographic identity](https://medium.com/@suign/me-cleaker-dynamic-interactions-within-spaces-allowing-different-interpretations-of-the-d03337195887)**, enhancing security and data integrity.*


## Import and use it in your project:
```bash
npm i all.this
```

## Example Usage
Module can be used like this:
```javascript
const allThis = require('all.this');
```

- [ ] Initiate and set up a context with [this.me.](https://suign.github.io/this.me)
- [ ] Keep [i.mlearning](https://suign.github.io/i.mlearning).
