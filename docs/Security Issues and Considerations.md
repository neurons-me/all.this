### Security Issues and Considerations:

#### a. Privilege Escalation:

Executing scripts with administrative privileges, especially those modifying system files like the `hosts` file, can inadvertently create openings for malicious software if not tightly controlled and monitored.

#### b. Insecure Modifications:

Changes to system-level configurations, such as DNS mappings, could potentially redirect users to unintended destinations, which can pose a risk if the configured domain is not secured.

#### c. Trust and Source Verification:

An installer that modifies system files may be seen as a potential threat or untrustworthy source by users and security software. Ensuring the authenticity of your installer and gaining user trust are critical.

#### d. Reversibility:

Changes should always be reversible without adverse effects on user systems. An uninstaller or reversal script should restore the original state as much as possible to prevent potential issues post-uninstallation.

#### e. Dependency Handling:

The installation and configuration of dependencies should be handled securely, with validated sources, verified downloads (using checksums), and ensuring that no insecure versions are used.
