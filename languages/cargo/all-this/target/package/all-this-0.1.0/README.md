## Overview
`all-this` is a foundational Rust crate in the **Neuroverse** ecosystem.  
It aims to provide a unified, flexible library of shared data structures, utility functions, and modular logic designed to support the broader infrastructure powering decentralized identity, computation, and interaction across tools like `cleaker`, `monad`, `netget`, and more.

---

## Goals
- Provide **common types** and shared models for cross-crate consistency.
- Serve as a **standard library** for internal projects within `neurons.me`.
- Enable **lightweight utilities** and logic to be reused across native apps, web services, and distributed agents.
- Establish a **core language** for identity, intent, and interaction within decentralized contexts.

---

## Roadmap
- [ ] Define core traits and primitives (e.g. `Identity`, `Intent`, `Have`, `Be`, `Do`)
- [ ] Build serialization and cross-runtime support (WASM, desktop, server)
- [ ] Create modular feature flags to adapt for different environments
- [ ] Publish on crates.io for wider open-source contribution

## Philosophy
This crate embodies the idea that everything meaningful in a system can be represented through simple verbs and relationships — to _have_, to _be_, and to _do_.
> “All. This.” — A system to unify the parts.
