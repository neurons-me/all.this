Hash functions (like SHA-256) take an input (or 'message') and return a fixed-size string, which appears random. The output, typically a "digest," is unique to the given input. Even a tiny change in the input will produce an entirely different output.

When discussing identity and verification, this becomes particularly important:

Data Integrity: You can be sure that the data (in this case, personal details) has not been altered if the hash value is as expected. Any change, no matter how small, would change the hash value.

Non-repudiation: Once you verify yourself and it gets hashed, you can't later deny having verified. This is because the hash value would be different if you hadn't verified yourself.

Identification: If the hash value matches a stored value, you can be reasonably sure about the identity of the person, as long as the hash function is resistant to collisions (i.e., different inputs producing the same hash).

Verification: Combining the hash with asymmetric cryptography can allow for verification. For example, you could sign the hash with a private key, and others can verify it with the associated public key. If the signature checks out, then the details haven't been altered since they were signed.
