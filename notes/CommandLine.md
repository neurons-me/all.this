command line interface (CLI)

Setting up Node.js command line interface (CLI) that's tailored to your environment, with easy access to your libraries, classes, binaries, and dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Script Setup:
Init environment.

Let's name this script myEnvCLI.js:

javascript
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env node

const myLibrary = require('./path-to-my-library');
const anotherLibrary = require('another-library');  // from node_modules

// Any other initializations, configurations, or imports

const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
  prompt: 'myEnvCLI> '
});

rl.prompt();

rl.on('line', (line) => {
  // Here you can handle the command line inputs and use your libraries or dependencies.
  // For example:
  if (line === 'useMyLibraryFunction') {
    console.log(myLibrary.someFunction());
  }

  rl.prompt();
}).on('close', () => {
  console.log('Exiting myEnvCLI...');
  process.exit(0);
});
The #!/usr/bin/env node at the start is called a shebang, which indicates that the script should be executed with Node.js.

2. Make Your Script Executable:
In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing myEnvCLI.js and run:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x myEnvCLI.js
This makes your JavaScript file executable.

3. Set Up package.json:
If you haven't already, initialize a package.json file using:

bash
Copy code
npm init
Then, add a bin section:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "my-application",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  // ... other fields ...
  "bin": {
    "myEnvCLI": "./path-to-script/myEnvCLI.js"
  }
}
This allows you to link the command myEnvCLI to your script.

4. Link Your Script Globally (optional):
To make your CLI available globally (accessible from any directory in your terminal), you can use npm's link command:

bash
Copy code
npm link
After running this, you can use myEnvCLI in your terminal just like any other command. The CLI will have access to all the libraries and dependencies specified in your myEnvCLI.js script and the local node_modules directory.

5. Run Your Custom CLI:
Now, you can simply run:

bash
Copy code
myEnvCLI
This will launch your custom CLI environment. From here, you can type commands that interact with your libraries, classes, binaries, and dependencies.

Note:
Remember that you'll need to handle various commands and potential errors in the rl.on('line', ...) section of the myEnvCLI.js script.
The above example gives you a basic CLI. Depending on your requirements, you may want to expand it, perhaps by using CLI libraries like Commander.js or Inquirer.js to make handling commands and user inputs more sophisticated.
